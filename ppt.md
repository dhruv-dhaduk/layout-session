Breaking down UI into components
===

# What is a component ?
- We are not talking about a react component. Facebook UI had components long before they created React.
- It is a piece of UI that is independent of other components.
- It can be a button, a text, a form, a list, etc.
- It has clear boundary.

# Why components are important ?
- Managing complexity
- Predictability
- Reusability
- Maintainability

Few things on the tools we are dealing with to create UI on web

Not all CSS is the same
===

Some CSS controls structure.  
Some CSS controls appearance.

# CSS that controls structure
- Positioning
- Alignment
- Spacing
- Flow
- Sizing behavior
- Scrolling

# CSS that controls appearance
- Color
- Background
- Border
- Font
- Shadows
- Decoration

We will be focusing on the one that controls structure.
